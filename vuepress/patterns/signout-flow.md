# Sign Out Flow
## Overview / Purpose
The sign out experience should be as impressive as the sign in experience. This is where we have the opportunity to thank and acknowledge the user for using our products. We should also make it easy to sign in again once the user has been signed out. 

## When to use
This should be implemented for all Moxi products for a cohesive experience and strong branding

## When not to use
Do not use this if it isn't for the sign out experience.

## Rules
1. If a loader is needed... show a consistent loader that we have in the product. (Loaders are often shown after 400ms) 
1. Confirmation: confirm for the user that they have been logged out
1. This is also a place where we can acknowledge the user and say something like ‘ You are now logged out, Thank you for using MoxiWorks.’ 
1. It should be easy to re-access and log in again
1. The log out experience should be as impressive and cohesive to the log in experience.
